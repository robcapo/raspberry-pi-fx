Initializes the G\+P\+I\+O pins used by the board pushbuttons. 

This function must be called during application initialization to configure the G\+P\+I\+O pins to which the pushbuttons are attached. It enables the port used by the buttons and configures each button G\+P\+I\+O as an input with a weak pull-\/up.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
None.

Polls the current state of the buttons and determines which have changed. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em pui8\+Delta} & points to a character that will be written to indicate which button states changed since the last time this function was called. This value is derived from the debounced state of the buttons. \\
\hline
{\em pui8\+Raw\+State} & points to a location where the raw button state will be stored.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
This function should be called periodically by the application to poll the pushbuttons. It determines both the current debounced state of the buttons and also which buttons have changed state since the last time the function was called.

In order for button debouncing to work properly, this function should be caled at a regular interval, even if the state of the buttons is not needed that often.

If button debouncing is not required, the the caller can pass a pointer for the {\itshape pui8\+Raw\+State} parameter in order to get the raw state of the buttons. The value returned in {\itshape pui8\+Raw\+State} will be a bit mask where a 1 indicates the buttons is pressed.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
Returns the current debounced state of the buttons where a 1 in the button I\+D's position indicates that the button is pressed and a 0 indicates that it is released. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
