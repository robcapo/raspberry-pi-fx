Guitar FX Pedal
===============

This is my final project for the Embedded Systems course I took at Rowan in Spring 2014.
A few of the C files were written by our professor (or by the class as a whole), and the
rest were written by me. The C++ files were written by me. Also included are compiled
doxygen documentation files that explain the hardware and software in a little more detail.
